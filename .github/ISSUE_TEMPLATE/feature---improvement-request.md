Note: It is my intent to keep Foundation as agile as possible.  Thus not to become bloated with excessive functionality that has caused the demise of so many themes as they struggle to be maintained with underlying changes.  Therefore the plan is for more specific functionality to be added to a child theme specific to you - child theme technology is not fully developed, yet!
