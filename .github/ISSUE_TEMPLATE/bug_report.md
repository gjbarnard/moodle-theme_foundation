**JSON settings export**
This can help with replication, but be aware that the values could contain information that is specific to your site.  Therefore please 'ensure' that you check the text throughly before adding, especially as these issues are public and can be read by anybody!

1. As a site administrator, go to 'Site administration' -> 'Appearance' -> 'Themes' -> 'Foundation' -> 'Import / export settings'.
2. Navigate to the bottom of the page and click on 'Export properties as a JSON string'.
3. Select and copy everything between the curly brackets '{' and '}'.
4. Paste into a text editor and check the contents for anything that you don't want to be public.  If there is something, then remove it leaving an empty pair of double quotes '""'.
5. Copy and paste into the issue.
