The Foundation theme story
=================================
Foundation is a Bootstrap theme that aims to be different and yet at the same time have some traditions of the past.
It does not extend the Boost theme but rather 'pull' the files it needs from it because that is where they are currently
stored.  No navigation drawer or docking has been implemented.  However, you can collapse and expand blocks and put them
in a 'drawer' region.

If you'd like to sponsor, get support or fund improvements, then please do get in touch via:

- gMail eMail | gjbarnard at gMail dt com.
- My website eMail | contact at gjbarnard dt co dt uk.
- GitHub | Please outline your issue / improvement on '[GitHub](https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-theme_foundation/issues)'.

Bespoke work
------------

If you would like your own customised version or a new child theme of Boost / Classic, then typically with a setting and a few
style changes this is usually two to three hours work.  I charge by the minute with a minimum time of fifteen.  Please contact
me for further details with an outline of what you would like.

Open source software
====================
Foundation is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) License it comes with NO support,
please see 'COPYING.txt'. If you would like support from me then I'm happy to provide it for a fee (please see my contact details
below).  Otherwise, the Moodle '[Themes](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46)' forum is an excellent place
to ask questions.

Foundation can be obtained from:

* [Moodle.org](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_foundation).
* [GitHub](https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-theme_foundation/releases).

You have all the rights granted to you by the GPLv3 license.  If you are unsure about anything, then the
FAQ - [GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) - is a good place to look.

If you reuse any of the code then I kindly ask that you make reference to the format.

If you make improvements or bug fixes then I would appreciate if you would send them back to me by forking from
[GitHub](https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-theme_foundation) and doing a 'Pull Request' so that the rest of the Moodle community
benefits.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle 5.0 version 20250414.00 (Build: 20250414) and above within the MOODLE_500_STABLE branch until the
next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in '[Installing Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/500/en/Installing_Moodle)'.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the current version for the major release of Moodle you are using.  It
is essential that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated above, this is because the theme relies on core functionality
that is out of its control.

If you think you've discovered a genuine bug with the theme then please look at the Moodle [Themes forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46) first to see if it
has already been repoted.  Secondly, look at [GitHub](https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-theme_foundation/issues).

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues in 'my' (not other developers of the theme) code, when fully described and
replicatable.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's
version.php file / or the top of the 'Information' settings tab.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version,
theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you
consider to be relevant.

You can use either the '[Themes forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46)' or '[GitHub](https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-theme_foundation/issues)'.
